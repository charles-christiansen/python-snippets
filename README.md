# python-snippets
A collection of small Python scripts for implementing various algorithms. Many (but not all) of these are my answers to LeetCode problems.

Note that I am using Python 3.10.1 on my developement machine, but if you're following along with the LeetCode problems, I can't guarantee
that they're using the same version. In particular, I use the newer | notation (int|None) rather than using Union or Optional from typing
that they seem to prefer.
